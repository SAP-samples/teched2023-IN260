# Minimal UI App

This folder contains a minimal front end app which combines [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)  
to build a small UI for the Todo service built using Java. 

## Build, Run, Test

You need:

* Node 18 +
* Npm 8+

Build and run the project with:

```bash
# cd frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

This starts the app on port 5175, and can be accessed at http://localhost:5175
